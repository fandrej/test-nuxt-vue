# COMPONENTS

The components directory contains your Vue.js Components.
Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components.

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

IMPORTANT:
The components/ folder must contains only "pure" Vue.js components
So you can't use asyncData inside
